**wikifarmchanges** is a nice one page overview of recent changes of
many wikis.

Some examples:
* [wiki.yt changes](http://wikiytchanges.meteor.com/)
* [hitchwiki changes](http://hitchwikichanges.meteor.com/)
* [crypto wiki changes](http://cryptowikichanges.meteor.com/)


It's doing the HTTP GETs directly from the client through
JSONP. There's almost nothing happening on the server.

wikifarmchanges is developed by [Kasper Souren](http://kasper.re/).
